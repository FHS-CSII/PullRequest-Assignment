 * 	- Create the following static methods:
 * 		- int threeAndFive() : Returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000
 * 		- int evenFibSum() : Returns the sum of the even-valued terms less than 4 million in the Fibonacci Sequence
 * 		- int largestPrimeFactor() : Returns the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143
 * 	- Create a separate Driver class and test your program by outputting the answers to your static methods
 *
